Hello COBOL, my old friend  
I've come to work with you again  
Because a vision softly creeping  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping  
And the vision that was planted in my brain  
Still remains  
Within new lines of COBOL  

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Unstructured code of modern zones
'Neath the halo of a stack lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a gre-een light
That split the night
And touched a line of COBOL

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand lines, maybe more
Statements talking without speaking
Compilers hearing without listening
People writing code for programs never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the lines of COBOL

"Fools" said I, "You do not know
COBOL like an Oak-Tree grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like abnormal endings fell
And echoed in the wells of Dribbleware

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon lua that they'd made
And the source flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the source said, "The words of the prophets are written on the redit walls
Stack-overflow halls"
And whispered in some lines of COBOL
